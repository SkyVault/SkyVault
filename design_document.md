## Game play and story

Each enemy has been infected by a plague

Your goal is not to hurt them but to heal them, 
if you kill them you don't gain anything

You heal each type of virus with different types of medicine,
if you don't have the right type you will be forced to kill the 
enemy.

This game you play a student doctor, and it turns out that you
cannot be infected by the virus.

The virus is vampiric. 

You are the only person that is immune, and you must go and find the plague 
doctors all over the world to help them research their strain of the virus.

### Medicine Gameplay

Got to think of a creative way to administer medicine, each color has a slightly different minigame?? 

#### Minigame ideas

1. Puzzle games would be interesting... though you would have to either generate a new puzzle, or design puzzles for each entity in the game.

2. Something like the whitness, where each medicine builds upon the last concept.
